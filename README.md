Warehouse Transportation Assistant Robot is a prototype Elegoo Smart Robot Car (Arduino UNO R3) that is mechanically designed to carry load. 

A transportation route is set up between the point where the robot receives the object and the object delivery point. The robot is programmed to use input from its tracking sensors to navigate and move through the transportation route. The robots also uses input from its ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles in its path and avoid collision.
